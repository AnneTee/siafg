## Local Development

1. Clone project and run `yarn` from inside the project root to install theme dependencies.

2. Run `yarn start` to view the project in the browser.

3. Create a file called `secrets.js` in the `app/services/` directory with this information:
`export const AIRTABLE_API_KEY = '[YOUR API KEY HERE]';`
If you do not have or know your API key, go to your AirTable Account overview to generate one.
